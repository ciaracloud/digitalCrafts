The overall goal of the game is to win the battle against your enemy, Vivian, so that you can make it to your interior design interview and get the job! You can choose which character you would like to be during your battle against Vivian. Each character has their own starting health level, strength level, and attack options, which are displayed in the character menu. All of the characters' confidence starts at 0 and the only way to gain enough confidence to land the job as an interior designer, and ultimately win the game, is to win the battle against Vivian. Once you are in the battle with Vivian, you can choose which attack option(s) to use against her and the game will continue until one of your health levels reach 0 or below!
