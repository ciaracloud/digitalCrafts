Question 1
 
We are building html for an email to send to a customer.  The method send_email() has the following function declaration:
 
 
send_email(email_to_address, email_body)
 
 
The email_body needs to contain the following customer information: first name, last name, phone number, and mailing address.  Use the following object to get the customer information:
 
 
let rec = {
 
    FIRST_NAME: 'John',
 
    LAST_NAME: 'Smith',
 
    EMAIL: 'john@example.com',
 
    PHONE_NUMBER: '888-777-6666',
 
    STREET: '1234 Ohio St.',
 
    CITY: 'Evansville',
 
    STATE: 'IN',
 
    POSTAL_CODE: '47701',
 
    COUNTRY: 'US'
 
};
 
 
Using server-side Javascript, write code that would build the email HTML and use the aforementioned function to send an email to the customer.
 
 
NOTE: The email text should be made-up and can be as short or long as you like.  Use your best judgment in this situation.
 
 
ANSWER 1.
 
I would construct the email using a template literal and depending on its setup I would
create the body to inject into the rest of the html like I did below or I would create and inject a full html document.
 
const emailHtml =
`<p>"hello ${rec.FIRST_NAME} ${rec.LAST_NAME}, please confirm in your reply that your telephone number is ${rec.PHONE_NUMBER} and your address is ${rec.STREET}, ${rec.CITY} ${rec.STATE}, ${rec.POSTAL_CODE}"</p>`;
 
send_email(rec.EMAIL, emailBody);
 
Question 2
 
Consider the following array of objects:
 
 
let recs = [
 
    {
 
        ID: 1,
 
        NAME: 'John',
 
        EMAIL: 'john@example.com',
 
        SSN: '123'
 
    }, {
 
        ID: 2,
 
        NAME: 'Sally',
 
        EMAIL: 'sally@example.com',
 
        SSN: '456'
 
    }, {
 
        ID: 3,
 
        NAME: 'Angie',
 
        EMAIL: 'angie@example.com',
 
        SSN: '789'
 
    }
 
];
 
 
Using server-side Javascript, write code that returns the same array of objects without the key "SSN".
 
ANSWER 2.
 
recs = recs.map(rec => ({
    ID: rec.ID, NAME: rec.NAME, EMAIL: rec.EMAIL
}))
 
 
Question 3
 
You are building a script in server-side Javascript that needs to send 10,000 emails to customers.  In plain English, describe how you would build the script to get customer information, build the email and send the email without overwhelming the server.  What pitfalls should be considered and avoided?
 
ANSWER 3.
 
I would query the database either with handwritten SQL or an ORM to get the customer information then I would use some kind of mapping function with a template literal to build the html and then send the email. To not overwhelm the server I would make sure that all operations were being performed asynchronously and if possible break the task down into smaller batch jobs instead of 10k at a time.
 
Question 4
 
Consider the following function declaration:
 
 
parse_margin(pdf = {})
 
 
pdf is a settings object that defines the styles for a PDF to be generated.  All keys are optional.  The full object reads as follows:
 
 
pdf = {
 
    printBackground: true,
 
    margin: {
 
        top: "30px",
 
        right: "0px",
 
        bottom: "30px",
 
        left: "0px"
 
    }
 
};
 
 
The purpose of parse_margin is to return the margins from the input object.
 
 
Using server-side Javascript, write the parse_margin function.  All margins default to "0px" if not defined.
 
ANSWER 4.
 
function parse_margin (pdf) {
    return {
        "top" : pdf.margin.top ? pdf.margin.top : "0px",
        "right" : pdf.margin.right ? pdf.margin.right : "0px",
        "left" : pdf.margin.left ? pdf.margin.left : "0px",
        "bottom" : pdf.margin.bottom ? pdf.margin.bottom : "0px",
    }
}
 
 
Question 5
 
Please compose a SQL query to select the top 100 active sales reps by volume of sales for the prior 30 days.
 
ANSWER 5.
 
SELECT TOP 100 FROM SalesReps WHERE activeStatus = true AND getDate() <= 30 ORDER BY SalesVolume
 
NOTE: Use your best judgment for column and table names.
